# CodSoft-Task3

# Overview
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses a Random Forest Classifier to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. The project also covers data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, and model evaluation.

# Libraries 
To get started with this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the data is clean and ready for machine learning. This includes handling missing values, normalizing features, and one-hot encoding categorical variables.

# Class Imbalance
Given the imbalance between genuine and fraudulent transactions, this project explores undersampling and oversampling techniques to balance the dataset.

# Model Training
A Random Forest Classifier is used to build the machine learning model, as it's well-suited for this classification task.

# Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is assessed using key metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into its ability to detect fraudulent transactions accurately.

# Hyperparameter Tuning
The model's hyperparameters are optimized to enhance its performance.

# Advanced Techniques
The project suggests exploring advanced techniques such as ensemble methods and deep learning for further model improvement.
